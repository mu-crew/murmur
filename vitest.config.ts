/**
 * These files drive a REAL tmux server and must not run beside each other.
 *
 * Each builds its own `-L` socket rig, so they do not share tmux state -- but
 * they still contend for the machine, and the symptom was pane-ownership's 5s
 * default timeout expiring while mux-targets was mid-spawn. Reproduced with ONLY
 * those two files selected (8 tests, nothing else running), which is what ruled
 * out "the machine happened to be busy" and named the real cause.
 *
 * `fileParallelism: false` for that pair via a separate project, so the rest of
 * the suite keeps running in parallel. A real tmux spawn also has no bounded
 * worst case, hence the longer `testTimeout` there and the 5s default
 * everywhere else -- where a slow test means a hang worth failing on.
