 *    write mixing this turn's cost with last turn's tokens would be a number
 *    nobody could interpret.
 * 2. Absence is a real state. An agent that has not completed a turn has no
 *    usage at all, which is different from having zero tokens, and flat columns
 *    would have to spell that with twelve nulls.
 * 3. Nothing renders it yet. These are for a display concern that does not
 *    exist: the card draws `model`, `effort` and `context_pct` only. Carrying
 *    the numbers now means the next display option costs no wire change, which
 *    is the whole argument for collecting them early -- and the wire is not
 *    compatible across versions, so adding a field later costs a coordinated
 *    upgrade of every node in the fleet.
 *
 * `cache_write_1h` and `reasoning` are optional WITHIN the object because only
 * some providers report them -- Anthropic splits cache retention, and a
 * reasoning breakdown exists only where the model exposes one. Absent means the
