 * waiting for you. That is `done`, the same fact pi's extension reports through
 * `settledState`. So one harness reported a finished turn as `done` and the
 * other reported it as `blocked`, and a codex agent that had simply finished
 * was indistinguishable from one waiting on an answer -- on every turn, not
 * rarely. It got louder once `blocked` began sorting oldest-first, which pinned
 * a stale turn-complete to the top of the picker.
 *
 * A TABLE keyed on the payload's own `type`, rather than a `--kind` flag: the
 * harness already says which event this is, and a flag would have to be right
 * in a config file nobody re-reads. An unknown type is not in the table and
 * falls back below.
 *
 * Cursor's stop hook is not in this table: it names the event
 * `hook_event_name` and puts the outcome in `status`, so `cursorStopKind`
 * reads those fields after the table miss.
 *
 * Only `done` and `blocked` appear, and adding `crashed` here would be a

 * died. That stays reconciliation's, which is the only thing holding the pid.

 * cannot say a process is alive, dead, or running. Which of the two
 * human-answerable requests an event means is a different question, and
 * hard-coding it to `blocked` answered it wrongly for every codex turn.
 *
 * `crashed` stays out of the table by intent: an external process cannot know a
 * process died, and only reconciliation holds the pid that could tell.

 * exemption: attention is addressed by pane, and a pane needs no host_id. So
