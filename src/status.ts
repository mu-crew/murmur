 * against a live attach pane, the whole output was
 * `ssh dev -t tmux attach -t mu-remote-1`, 38 characters, no environment at all.
 * `ps -E` behaves the same and there is no /proc, so an env prefix
 * (`MU_AGENT_NAME=x ssh ...`) is consumed by the shell and never observable.
 * The `e` flag that appends the environment is a Linux ps extension.
 *
 * The agent name IS in the argv for both remote recipes, which is why this
 * works where the env read could not: a direct spawn carries it in the remote
 * command, and the detached-tmux shape carries it in the session name, since mu
 * names the session after the agent. That is a convention rather than a
 * guarantee -- so a miss costs the attachment hint and nothing else, and the
 * word boundary keeps `worker-1` from matching `worker-10`.

 *   the remote command or in the session name (mu names the session
 *   `mu-<agent>`).
 * - the PANE ID catches a jump through the peer's configured jump command,
 *   which renders `{pane}` and so names the pane and nothing else. Measured with
 *   a real ET jump: argv was `x2ssh -et dev -c tmux attach -t %45`, in which the
 *   agent name appears nowhere -- so the name matcher alone missed exactly the
 *   case the back-reference exists for, since a second attach through the
 *   DEFAULT ssh jump command is what fails on a session-capped host.
 *
