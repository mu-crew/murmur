/**
 * The escape-sequence rules the dash preview lives by.
 *
 * A pane's colours are the fastest signal a reader has: red test output, a green
 * diff, the inverse block of a selection. `capture-pane -e` hands those back, so
 * the preview can show what the pane actually looks like instead of a grey slab.
 *
 * That makes the dash a consumer of arbitrary terminal bytes, and only one class
 * of them is safe. SGR (`CSI ... m`) paints the cell in place and cannot move
 * anywhere; everything else in the repertoire either leaves the preview box
 * (cursor movement, erases, scroll regions) or does something to the operator's
 * machine (OSC 52 clipboard writes, titles, sixel and kitty image payloads).
 * Hence the shape here: an allow-list of one sequence type, and a scanner that
 * drops the rest rather than a sanitiser that pattern-matches known offenders.
 *
 * Hand-written rather than a parser dependency, because the grammar this needs
 * is one function: ECMA-48 fixes the terminators, and nothing here interprets
 * parameters -- SGR is copied through verbatim, so truecolor, colon-delimited
 * T.416 forms, and attributes murmur has never heard of all work without a
 * table to keep current.
