# murmur

**Every coding agent you have running, on every machine, in one list.**

![murmur dash — cards on the left, pane glance on the right](docs/dash.png)

One agent is blocked waiting on you. Which machine is it on? murmur answers
that and jumps you there.

**Talk to any agent without leaving the dashboard—even when it runs on another
machine.** Press `i`, write a prompt, and send it straight to the selected tmux
pane over SSH. Press `ctrl-e` to stop the agent. The dashboard stays open, so
you can move between agents without moving between terminals.

## Surfaces

| Command | Job |
| --- | --- |
| `murmur status` | Attention-state rollups plus the total crew count for a tmux status bar |
| `murmur pick` | fzf jump list — type to narrow, enter jumps, `ctrl-a` / `--all` toggles crew |
| `murmur dash` | Watch and talk to local or remote agents without leaving the dashboard |
| `murmur sidepanel` | Show a compact agent list beside the current tmux window |

Orchestrated (`crew`) agents stay hidden from state rollups unless they are
`blocked` or `crashed`—their supervisor consumes anything else. `murmur status`
also emits their total as a separate `crew` record, including those urgent
agents. Local jump is a window switch; remote jump opens over ssh (or your
`--jump-command`).

`murmur dash` wants a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and a Catppuccin
Mocha terminal. Press `?` for its shortcut panel. `/` filters cards by agent,
workstream, session, host, or state; `c` toggles compact one-line rows. Press
`i` to compose a prompt for the selected local or remote agent; opening it
clears the agent's done/blocked mark, as focusing its pane would. In input mode,
enter sends, `ctrl-e` stops the agent, and escape returns to the dashboard.
`s` **node** sort is local cards first, then remotes A–Z.

`murmur sidepanel` shows the same local and remote agents, with the dashboard's
saved sort and visibility preferences. Press `a` to toggle crew agents, `j` or
`k` to move, `g` or `G` to jump to an edge, and enter to jump to the selected
agent. A successful jump closes the panel; a failed jump leaves it open and
shows the error. Press `q` or `Ctrl-C` to close it. See
[side panel setup](docs/setup.md#side-panel).

## Install

Needs tmux, [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent), `fzf`, and
Node 20+. Multi-machine: ssh access, murmur on each node.

On every node that runs agents:

```bash
npm install -g @martintrojer/murmur
murmur init      # this node's identity
murmur link pi   # install the agent-side extension
```

Agents must run **inside tmux**. A tmux server plus pane id is the address;
without one there is nothing to jump to. Remote agents need tmux on the remote
too — the jump uses
`ssh -t <host> env LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8 tmux attach` unless you override it.

Add focus hooks so looking at a finished agent clears its badge — see
[docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md#tmux-focus-hooks). Wire Codex / Cursor /
opencode notify hooks in the same file.

`PREFIX G` returns you to the dash from anywhere: it switches to the running
dash, or leaves a murmur-controlled remote session so the local client comes
back on its own — see
[docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md#one-key-back-to-the-dash).

### Watch more than one machine

```bash
murmur peer add devbox
murmur doctor            # is peering mutual?
bind -N "agent state picker" a display-popup -E -w 80% -h 60% "murmur pick"
bind -N "go to murmur dash" G run-shell -b "murmur dash --goto"
```

Peering is one-way until both sides add each other. Hard ssh cases (second
factor / `BatchMode`, `MaxSessions 1`, Eternal Terminal): [SSH.md](SSH.md).

## What it is / is not

- **Is:** a state layer over tmux — reported from inside the agent, pulled
  peer-to-peer over ssh. No daemon. Current snapshot only; a peer answer is
  replaced whole, and absence means absence. Nothing murmur stores or sends is
  read out of a terminal; the one exception is cosmetic, and the dashboard
  labels it: for an agent that reports no model or context, the selected card
  falls back to summarising that pane's own output.
- **Is not:** an orchestrator ([`mu`](https://github.com/martintrojer/mu)
  places work), a remote terminal, or a multiplexer replacement.
