 * The suite must not be able to tell what the developer's shell exports.
 *
 * Six tests in extension-decide.test.ts passed on the maintainer's machine and
 * failed in every other checkout, on byte-identical files, because his shell
 * had MURMUR_STORE_MODULE set -- which is what `murmur link pi` tells you to
 * do. The tests mock the bare "@mu-crew/murmur/extension-store"
 * specifier; vitest mocks by resolved path; the variable made the extension
 * import a different path, so the mock never applied.
 *
 * These tests guard the rig itself, in the three ways it can rot.
