/**
 * What an operator is told when a peer is broken.
 *
 * `last_error` and the one line `murmur collect` prints are the WHOLE
 * diagnostic for a machine the operator is not sitting at. Every other surface
 * reduces a failed peer to `stale`, so a message that does not name the problem
 * sends them to read code on the other host.
 *
 * This file exists because the two-node smoke test found both assertions below
 * failing against real hosts, and neither was covered: `collector.test.ts`
 * asserts `describeFailure` on hand-written strings that happen to omit the
 * `Command failed:` prefix every real `execFile` rejection carries, and
 * `snapshot.test.ts` asserts only the CLASS of a parse failure, never the text.
