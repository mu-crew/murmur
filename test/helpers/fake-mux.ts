/**
 * A Mux that answers every method with a harmless default.
 *
 * Five separate hand-rolled fakes used to spell this out, so adding one method
 * to the interface broke four unrelated test files. Each test overrides only
 * the methods whose behaviour it is actually asserting on, which also makes the
 * override list a readable statement of what the test is about.
 *
 * The defaults are chosen so a test that forgets an override fails rather than
 * passes: no windows, no sessions, no client.
 *
 * ONE DEFAULT BREAKS THAT PROMISE, deliberately and with a cost worth knowing.
 * `panesInWindow: () => []` describes a state real tmux cannot return: if
 * `windowForPane` just resolved a pane's window, that window contains at least
 * that pane. Two badge tests combined a resolved window with the empty default
 * and passed for years, asserting against an impossible world -- they only
 * surfaced when `notify` started recomputing the badge from the window's panes
 * and suddenly needed the fixture to be coherent.
 *
 * Left as `[]` rather than made to throw, because plenty of tests legitimately
 * never touch it and a throwing default would force noise into all of them. So:
 * IF YOUR TEST RESOLVES A WINDOW, STUB THIS TOO. A passing badge assertion
 * against the default is not evidence.
