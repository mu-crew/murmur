/**
 * A standalone process that loads the REAL built extension and fires one event.
 *
 * Prints `RAN <pid>` and nothing else: whether the claim was accepted or refused
 * is a fact about the store, not something this process can see.
 *
 * Exists so `pane-ownership.test.ts` can reproduce the six-pid bug with actual
 * operating-system processes in an actual tmux pane. The bug is entirely about
 * what a SEPARATE process inherits -- $TMUX_PANE, and the owner's claim -- so a
 * mocked child cannot reproduce it: the inheritance IS the mechanism.
 *
 * argv[2] is the state to report. It stays alive until killed so that the
 * "recorded pid is still alive" floor has something live to protect, which is
 * the condition the real bug violated.

// in pane-ownership.test.ts are what close it. Halving the runtime is what makes
// those budgets rarely matter.
