/**
 * Attention as an INDEPENDENT channel, asserted through the two commands that
 * write it rather than through the store alone.
 *
 * test/store.test.ts already proves `requestAttention` and `acknowledgePane`
 * cannot address an agent. That is the schema's claim. This file makes the
 * claim about the SHIPPED PATHS: `murmur notify` and `murmur clear` are what
 * ran on panes %250-%252, they resolve their own location, they open their own
 * store handle, and it was their composition -- notify then focus, against a
 * live owner -- that nulled agent_name, workstream, role and driver. A store
 * that cannot say the wrong thing is only half the guarantee if a caller can
 * still reach a wider write.
 *
 * Every assertion reads the `agents` table COLUMN BY COLUMN out of SQLite,
 * because `localPanes()` deliberately omits `owner_pid` and could not show a
 * corrupted one.
