# Setup

Wire murmur after `npm install -g @mu-crew/murmur`. Selling and surface
overview: [README](../README.md). Hard ssh cases: [SSH.md](../SSH.md).

## Per-node init

On every node that runs agents:

```bash
murmur init      # this node's identity
murmur link pi   # install the agent-side extension
```

`link pi` writes a one-line extension into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` that
re-exports this install. `npm install -g` is the upgrade path; re-run `link pi`
only if the install path moves. `link pi --copy` inlines the extension and pins
it — re-link after every upgrade if you use that form.

Running agents keep the old extension code until they restart. Order matters:
without `murmur init` the extension loads and records nothing. Agents must run
**inside tmux**. A pane is the address; without one there is nothing to jump to.

## tmux focus hooks

Looking at a finished agent clears its badge. On every node, in `.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set-hook -g after-select-pane      "run-shell -b 'murmur clear --pane #{pane_id}'"
set-hook -g after-select-window    "run-shell -b 'murmur clear --pane #{pane_id}'"
set-hook -g client-session-changed "run-shell -b 'murmur clear --pane #{pane_id}'"
```

These are per node and not optional. `murmur clear` is what acknowledges an
attention request. A node's own snapshot is what every peer reads — without
these hooks, finished agents stay `done` in every peer's list.

Verify with `tmux show-hooks -g`. `set-hook` accepts a name your tmux does not
have and exits 0, so a wrong name fails silently.

Pass the pane id explicitly: hooks run in the tmux server, where `$TMUX_PANE` is
unset. Without it, a window holding an agent and a shell clears when you focus
the shell.

Focus can only cancel attention. It cannot stop a running agent or alter what
the agent reported about itself.

## Side panel

Bind the side panel in `.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
bind C-m run-shell "murmur sidepanel"
```

Then press `prefix + C-m` to toggle it for the current window. This key is free
in tmux's default prefix table. `prefix + m` and `prefix + M` are not free: tmux
uses them to set and clear a pane mark.

The panel opens on the left at 25 percent of the window width clamped to
25–40 columns, then shrinks to fit its widest line (never below 16 columns). It
spans the full viewport even when the existing layout is nested, and takes focus. Toggling it again removes only that window's panel.

Press `j` or `Down` to select the next agent, and `k` or `Up` to select the
previous agent. Press `g` or `Home` to select the first agent, and `G` or `End`
to select the last agent. Press `?` to show all panel keys. Press `?` or
`Escape` to close the help panel. Press `c` to toggle compact one-line rows. The
side panel and dashboard share this compact setting, along with the saved sort
and visibility settings.

## Harnesses other than pi

pi reports in-process through the extension. Codex, opencode, and the Cursor CLI
have no such hook — they run a command when something happens — so they use
`murmur notify`, which records an attention request for the pane it runs in.

This path is attention only: no ownership, no `running`/`idle`, no crash
detection. Unrecognised events become `blocked`, so a new harness still puts a
row in front of you.

### Codex

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
notify = ["murmur", "notify", "--source", "codex"]
```

Do not wrap with `sh -lc` alone. Codex appends the event JSON as one more
argument, and `sh -lc '<script>' <arg>` puts that argument in `$0` rather than
`$1` — the wrapper swallows the payload. Exec murmur directly, or forward
explicitly:

```toml
notify = ["/bin/sh", "-lc", "exec murmur notify --source codex \"$@\"", "codex-notify"]
```

Codex fires `agent-turn-complete` (turn ended, waiting for you) — murmur records
`done`. opencode's `session.idle` means the same thing. Drop `--title Codex` if
you have it; the message falls back to the payload's `last-assistant-message`.

The same fields may arrive as JSON on stdin (opencode's plugin form). argv wins
when both are present; flags still beat the payload, so `--event-type` can pin
an event murmur does not know.

### Cursor CLI

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "stop": [
      {
        "command": "murmur notify --source cursor"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`~/.cursor/hooks.json` (user) or `.cursor/hooks.json` (project). `status:
completed` → `done`; `aborted` or `error` → `blocked`. The agent must run inside
tmux. Interactive `agent` sessions are the target; non-interactive `agent -p`
has been observed to omit `stop`.

### PATH in hooks

A notify hook inherits the PATH of whatever launched the harness. `/bin/sh -l`
does not fix a missing npm prefix. Verify from inside the harness:

```bash
murmur notify --source probe --message reachable && murmur status
murmur clear --pane "$TMUX_PANE"
```

If `murmur` is missing there, use the absolute path from `command -v murmur`.

The probe is a real attention request: no event name → `blocked`, so the window
badges. `murmur clear` (or focus, with the hooks above) takes it back.

`notify` outside tmux records nothing and exits 0, so it cannot break the
caller's exit code. A pane reached only via notify is still a full jumpable
row.

## Peers and doctor

On the machine you watch from:

```bash
murmur peer list         # configured peers, last seen
murmur peer list --all   # also ssh hosts that could become peers
murmur peer add devbox
murmur doctor            # survey each peer over ssh
murmur doctor --topology # also probe who can reach whom
```

`peer list` is local. `doctor` dials out. Membership is per node: peering a
machine does not mean it peers you — if it does not peer back, its list cannot
see your agents. `doctor` writes nothing and repairs nothing; it prints the
commands. Exit 0 for observations, 1 only for a real problem. Suggestions name
this node as it calls itself; that name may not resolve from the peer's side.
`peer add` accepts a target that does not answer yet and discovers identity on
the first collect.

`--topology` costs one dial per ordered pair. Plain `doctor` answers "is my
fleet mutual?"; `--topology` answers "what shapes are possible here?". A
recommended hub is arithmetic on that matrix. Spokes see the hub and the hub
sees every spoke; **spokes do not see each other** — `export` publishes local
panes only. A pair that was not demonstrably up reads `unknown`, not
unreachable.

Asleep or powered-off nodes are normal. `status`, `pick`, `dash`, and
`sidepanel` stay silent about that. `murmur peer list` has LAST SEEN; `murmur collect` (run on purpose)
prints one line per peer it could not reach.

Bind a popup picker:

```tmux
bind -N "agent state picker" a display-popup -E -w 80% -h 60% "murmur pick"
```

Rows use the shared picker prefix `marker · 30-column agent · state · context`, matching the `tms` session picker while retaining Murmur's state word, stream, host, age, and flags.

Typing in pick matches agent name, workstream or tmux session, host, and the
state word as literal substrings — so `blocked` narrows without a dedicated
binding.

## One key to the dash and back

After a jump, getting back depends on where the agent lives: a local agent is
an ordinary tmux move, a remote one hands the keyboard to the remote server.
Bind one key that covers both:

```tmux
bind -N "toggle murmur dash" G run-shell -b "murmur dash --goto"
```

Add it on every machine you jump to, not just the one you sit at — on a remote
host it is the remote tmux that reads the key.

`murmur dash --goto` decides in this order:

1. **In a murmur-controlled remote session** it detaches. The wrapper's own
   restore command then returns the local client to where the jump started.
2. **In the dash** it goes back to the pane you pressed the key in last. If that
   pane is gone it goes to its window. If the window is gone too, it stays in
   the dash and says `nothing to go back to`.
3. **With a dash running** it records where you are and switches to the dash.
   This includes an ordinary `ssh` login to a machine that has its own dash.
4. **With no dash running** it records where you are, opens `murmur dash` in a
   window of the dedicated `murmur-dash` session, and switches to it. On a node
   without `murmur init` it refuses instead, because the dash would exit at once.

The side panel is an ordinary pane, so the key works there and the split is
left alone: back returns you to the panel as you left it.

A dash marks its pane for as long as it runs, and murmur marks the one client
its own jump attaches. The way back is one option per client,
`@murmur_return_<client>`, so two terminals toggling at once do not trade
places. All three are tmux options, so nothing is inferred from process
ancestry or history. A dash killed with `SIGKILL` cannot clear its marker, so
`--goto` checks the pane is still alive before switching and opens a new dash
if it is not.

The `murmur-dash` session has `detach-on-destroy off`: quitting the dash with `q`
moves your client to another session instead of detaching the terminal.

`run-shell -b` backgrounds the call, so the key never blocks the server. The
cost is that a failure message goes nowhere; run `murmur dash --goto` by hand
to see it.

The client mark applies to the next client that attaches to the remote tmux
server. A jump command override that does not itself attach a tmux client, or
attaches after some other client does, leaves the jump unmarked — then `--goto`
switches to the remote host's own dash instead of coming home.

## Jump command override

`target` is always ssh (collector). The jump command is for a human and need not
be ssh:

```bash
murmur peer set dev --jump-command 'et dev -c "tmux attach -t {pane}"'
```

murmur substitutes `{pane}` and runs the rest unparsed. Default is
`ssh -t <target> env LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8 tmux attach`. The explicit UTF-8 locale
keeps Nerd Font glyphs intact when the remote SSH login has no locale. Override
the command when sshd sets `MaxSessions 1` — see [SSH.md](../SSH.md).

Remote jump from inside tmux opens a local wrapper session named after the peer
with a trailing `~`:

- `status off` — the remote's bar is the only one on screen
- `prefix None` — `^b` goes straight to the remote

Both are per-session. Leaving the remote returns you to the window you jumped
from and destroys the wrapper. Jumping to the same host twice reuses one
session. Outside tmux, pick/dash run ssh directly and you land back at your
shell on exit.

Inside the wrapper the local tmux has no prefix. Escape hatch (root table —
not `M-b` / other Alt letters that would eat picker's own filters):

```tmux
bind -n M-Escape if-shell -F '#{m:*~,#{session_name}}' detach-client
```

## Snapshot versions

All nodes must speak the same snapshot format. A mismatch is rejected rather
than guessed — the peer shows as reachable-but-broken with the reason.
`murmur peer list` shows each peer's version. Patch versions that share a
snapshot major interoperate.
