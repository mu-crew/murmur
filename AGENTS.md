# Agent notes

## Docs

| Doc | Reach when |
| --- | --- |
| [README.md](README.md) | product surfaces, comparison with herdr / workmux / mu, install one-liner, what murmur is not |
| [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) | tmux clear hooks, side panel binding, `murmur notify` for Codex/Cursor, peers, doctor, jump overrides |
| [SSH.md](SSH.md) | BatchMode, warm ControlMaster, `MaxSessions 1`, Eternal Terminal |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | activity / attention / freshness model, single-writer invariants, design costs, known gaps |

Working specs under `docs/specs/` stay local and gitignored. Do not treat them as
shipped truth; prefer ARCHITECTURE and the code.

## Always typecheck, lint and format clean

Non-negotiable. `main` is clean at every commit; there is no "fix lint later"
commit in this repo.

```sh
npm run check      # typecheck + lint + test, the full gate
npm run lint:fix   # biome check --write: fixes lint AND formatting
```

- `npm run lint` is `biome check --error-on-warnings`. Warnings fail. If
  `noExplicitAny` or `noNonNullAssertion` fires, fix the code. Do not silence
  the rule to get green.
- A `pre-commit` hook in `.githooks/` runs typecheck and lint on any staged
  `src/`, `test/` or `scripts/` file. `npm install` wires it up via `prepare`.
- Tests are deliberately not in the hook. They belong to your task's own
  validation step, and a slow hook is a hook people bypass.
- `git commit --no-verify` exists for WIP on a branch. Do not use it to land
  work on `main`.

## npm registry proxy

The dev shell can set `HTTPS_PROXY` and `https_proxy` to an unavailable local
proxy. If `npm install` stalls or reports a proxy `503`, confirm the problem
with:

```sh
curl -I --connect-timeout 5 https://registry.npmjs.org/commander
```

If the proxy fails but direct access works, retry npm without those variables:

```sh
env -u HTTPS_PROXY -u https_proxy npm install
```

Do not change the user's global npm or proxy configuration.
